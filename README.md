SwiftUI connect to Node.js sever via Socket.io pacakge....

this demo orignal from https://github.com/nuclearace/socket.io-client-swift-example/tree/master
I just make some change to let it run with SwiftUI 5 , 
the serve script from here https://github.com/nuclearace/socket.io-client-swift-example/tree/master/server  and needs update to latest version of Socket.io (4.x.x)

npm outdated
npm update 

My code has some clutter , just for demo purpose....
